How does the canbus speed compare to the actual speed on the road measured by the NDW loops?
```{r}

require("RPostgreSQL")
require("ggplot2")
require("hexbin")

drv <- dbDriver("PostgreSQL")
con <- dbConnect(drv, dbname = "research",
                 host = "localhost", port = 5433,
                 user = "postgres")

#How many unique id's are active per day
df_postgres <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT c_time, c_speed, l_speed FROM canbus.tmp_canbusndwspeed;");

ggplot(df_postgres,aes(c_time)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = c_speed, color = "Canbus")) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = l_speed, color = "NDW"))  +
  geom_vline(type=4,xintercept=as.numeric(as.POSIXct("2017-09-14 17:06:00+02"))) +
  theme_bw()

```
Not bad, although there are some significant outliers. These are mainly explainable by:
1. GPS point is inaccurate and assigned to wrong NDW loop
2. Vehicle is standing next to the road (under-estimate)
3. Vehicle is taking the exit-ramp, bypassing traffic (over-estimate)
